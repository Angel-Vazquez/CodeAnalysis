# CodeAnalysis
A 4D component to provide analysis capabilities on the 4d source and data.

Some older documentation is available here: http://openroaddevelopment.com/projects_4dComponent_CodeAnalysis.html

I will update the readme at some point in the future.


### Other Components used by CodeAnalysis when developing
I use these two components (also public repositories). You will need to grab them. I have done any notorizations yet. I guess I will need to cross that bridge.
